## Code of EUSpeech data collection

This repository is designed to give users of and contributors to the EUSpeech data an idea about how it was collected.

The code is structured as follows:
- The code used to collect [the original EUSpeech dataset](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/XPCVEI) can be found in the [**EUSpeech V1**](https://github.com/nicolaiberk/EUSpeech/tree/master/EUSpeech%20V1)-folder.
- the code for the upcoming release of additional data is found in [**EUSpeech V2**](https://github.com/nicolaiberk/EUSpeech/tree/master/EUSpeech%20V2).
  - [**Original**](https://github.com/nicolaiberk/EUSpeech/tree/master/EUSpeech%20V2/Original) contains the code used for the first collection in summer 2019.
  - [**CovidUpdate**](https://github.com/nicolaiberk/EUSpeech/tree/master/EUSpeech%20V2/CovidUpdate) contains additional files of a collection in spring 2020.
  
Additionally, the folder [EUSpeech Future Collections](https://github.com/nicolaiberk/EUSpeech/tree/master/EUSpeech%20Future%20Collections) contains a guide on how to collect data using the functions developed as part of this project, together with example code<sup>1</sup>.
